<h1>The Best Movies From The Golden Age of Hollywood</h1>
<h2>My absolute fave movies from the 50s</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Some Like It Hot</h3>
    <p>This movie is laugh-out-loud funny and features some of Marilyn Monroe's best onstage looks. 
    I love the comedy aspects of this and the fact Marilyn held her own incredibly well with two 
    amazing comediens shows her range. If you're looking for a good comfort movie, this is the one!</p>
<h3>Diabolique</h3>
    <p>French Alfred Hitchcock meets pseudo lesbian love story. This is one of the best psychological thrillers
    I've seen and I highly reccomend. If a mistress and wife murdering a man together isn't a strong enough plot 
    for you than I don't know what is!</p>
<h3>Singing in the Rain</h3>
    <p>Technicolor was created for a moment like this. The imagery and cinemitography of this film are absolutely insane
    This movie is the musical of all musicals and I strongly believe that even someone who doesn't like musicals would
    thouroughly enjoy this bright, fun, entertaining and colorful film.</p>
